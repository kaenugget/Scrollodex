### 3.4. Relationship Stats Definitions

The four core relationship stats provide a comprehensive view of the relationship's health and dynamics:

- **Connection (0-100):** Represents the depth of the emotional bond and mutual understanding. This is the core "health" of the friendship, indicating closeness and empathy.
- **Reliability (0-100):** Measures the level of trust and dependability. A high Reliability score means this is a friend you can count on to be there for you and keep their promises.
- **Communication (0-100):** Reflects the quality and consistency of interaction. It measures how well you both keep in touch and engage in meaningful conversation.
- **Energy (0-100):** Indicates the overall vibe and dynamic of the friendship. A high Energy stat signifies a fun, positive, and uplifting presence.

### 3.5. Stat Measurement Strategies

The relationship stats can be measured through a combination of automated data analysis and manual user input:

#### Automated Measurement (Data-Driven)

- **Connection:** Analyze sentiment of notes/moments, length of relationship, shared experiences count, frequency of deep conversations
- **Reliability:** Track response rate to messages, follow-through on actions/todos, consistency of check-ins, meeting attendance
- **Communication:** Measure frequency of interactions, message length/depth, response time, variety of communication channels used
- **Energy:** Analyze positive sentiment in interactions, shared activities, emoji usage, exclamation marks in messages, meeting duration vs. planned

#### Manual Input Options

- **Connection:** User can manually adjust based on gut feeling, significant life events shared, level of vulnerability in conversations
- **Reliability:** User can rate after specific interactions (kept/missed commitments, was there in crisis, etc.)
- **Communication:** User can note quality beyond quantity (meaningful vs. surface-level chats)
- **Energy:** User can rate the "vibe" after interactions (energized, neutral, drained)

#### Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

- Start with baseline automated scores
- Allow manual overrides/adjustments via simple UI controls (slider or +/- buttons)
- AI-suggested adjustments based on notes/moments content analysis
- Periodic "check-in" prompts asking user to confirm or adjust stats

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The page should render instantly. A loading indicator must be shown for the AI-generated summary, which may have a slight delay.
- **Accessibility:**
  - The "Back" button must be keyboard-focusable and have a clear, descriptive label.
  - All text must have sufficient color contrast against its background.
  - Headings (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`) must be used semantically to structure the page content.
- **UI/UX:**
  - The layout should feel balanced, clean, and easy to parse.
  - A subtle fade-in animation should be used on page load to create a smooth transition from the list view.
  - Upon navigating to the page, the window should automatically scroll to the top.

## 5. Technical Specifications

- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **API:** Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`) for generating the dynamic summary.
